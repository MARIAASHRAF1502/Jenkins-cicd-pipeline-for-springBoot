# What is CI/CD pipeline ?

A CI/CD pipeline stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline. It is a set of automated processes and tools that facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of software in a consistent and reliable manner. It's a key aspect of modern software development and aims to streamline the development, testing, and deployment of code changes.

# What is Jenkins ?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates the building, testing, and deployment of code in a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. It's one of the most widely used tools for automating software development workflows.

# Steps involved in CI/CD Pipeline 

1. Automate the process to handle changes in the GitHub Repository and generate a new .jar file.
2. Automatically create a Docker image whenever there are changes in the GitHub Repository.
3. Deploy these Docker images for production.

#### NOTE :
- All of these steps are configured within the Jenkins pipeline script.
